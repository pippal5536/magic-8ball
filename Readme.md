## Introduction
This project is a simple JavaScript program that simulates a Magic Eight Ball. The program allows the user to input a question and then outputs a random fortune as the answer.

## Project Problem
The challenge was to create a program that mimics the behavior of a Magic Eight Ball, using control flow in JavaScript to generate random responses to user questions. The goal was to practice using conditional statements, random number generation, and string interpolation.

## Solution Overview
The solution involves a JavaScript program that:
1. Takes the user's name as input.
2. Uses a ternary operator to greet the user by name or with a generic greeting.
3. Prompts the user to ask a question.
4. Generates a random number between 0 and 7 using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`.
5. Uses a switch statement to map the random number to one of eight possible Magic Eight Ball responses.
6. Outputs the user's question and the Magic Eight Ball's answer.


## Challenges Faced
One challenge was deciding whether to use `if/else` statements or a `switch` statement for controlling the flow based on the random number generated. Understanding the best use case for each control flow structure was key.

## Lessons Learned
- How to use the ternary operator for simple conditional expressions.
- The importance of understanding JavaScript's random number generation (`Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`).
- The basics of control flow using `switch` statements to manage multiple conditions.
- How to use template literals for clean and readable string interpolation in JavaScript.

## Project Sources and Inspiration
This project was developed as part of Codecademy's Learn JavaScript course, which offers practical exercises to reinforce key programming concepts.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used to create the Magic Eight Ball logic.
- **Codecademy**: The platform where the project was developed and learned.

## Installation and Usage
To run this project:
1. Ensure you have a JavaScript runtime environment (like Node.js) or access to a web browser console.
2. Copy the provided JavaScript code into your environment or a `.js` file.
3. Execute the code to see the Magic Eight Ball in action.

Example with Node.js:
```bash
node magicEightBall.js
```
